This project is my personal project that I intend to treat it as a tutorial, guidance, and reference for myself and others.

I worked as a Software Engineer for a number of years and my main task was only designing, coding and dockerizing. Then one day I got an opportunity to work as a Platform Engineer which requires a different set of skills such as DevOps, Cloud Knowledge, CI Pipeline, Observability and many more.

So, I decided to create this project to help me learn all those new skills while also documenting it and hope that this project might benefit someone or at the very least serve as one of my portfolio project.

> This project is for learning purpose only, so the quality of the project might not be production ready and I intend it to be that way. So please make sure you review any code, script, or configuration before using it.

# Project Overview
Every piece of art start with a good planning, this section will contain all the steps and diagrams, so you can see how this project is being build and enhance.

## Journey 1
At this very step, we will try to create an application that work locally and has one database. I choose a todo application with mongodb as it database. As I told you the purpose of this project is learning and not problem solving, so I choose todo application which is easy to start with and mongodb because we might add more functionalities or features to the application and NoSQL database serve that purpose.

**Objective**: Build a todo app
**Requirements**:
- app should be able to run locally
- app should be able to register new user
- app should be able to create todo for user
- app should be able to get todo items for user
- app should be able to get todo detail for user
- app should be able to delete a specific todo belong to user

## Journey 2 (Draft)
Remove local dependency with Docker and Docker Compose and Build

## Journey 3 (Draft)
Deployment

### Journey 3.1 (Draft)
CI/CD

## Journey 4 (Draft)
Transform monolithic app into microservices (modify app, modify CI/CD)

## Journey 5 (Draft)
Scaling with Kubernetes

### Journey 5.1 (Draft)
Improve deployment with ArgoCD

## Journey 6 (Draft)
Observability(logging, monitoring, tracing)

## Journey 7 (Draft)
Toward IaC

## Journey 8 and more (Draft)
ideas
- extend app features
- event driven architecture
