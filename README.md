This project is my hobby that I intend to treat it as a tutorial, guidance, and reference for myself and others.

I created this project to show a journey on how a simple application being built and transformed. It will start with a coding follow by DevOps practices and tools.

> This project is for learning purpose only, so the quality of the project might not be production ready and I intend it to be that way. So please make sure you review any code, script, or configuration before using it.

# Project Overview
Every piece of art start with a good planning, this section contains all the steps or diagrams, so you can see how this project is being build and enhance.

## Journey 1
At this very step, we will try to create an application that work locally and has one database. I choose a todo application with mongodb as it database. As I told you the purpose of this project is learning and not problem solving, so I choose todo application which is easy to start with and mongodb because we might add more functionalities or features to the application and NoSQL database serve that purpose.

**Objective**: Build a todo app
**Requirements**:
- app should be able to run locally
- app should be able to register new user
- app should be able to create todo for user
- app should be able to get todo items for user
- app should be able to get todo detail for user
- app should be able to delete a specific todo belong to user

## Journey 2 (Draft)
Remove local dependency with Docker and Docker Compose and Build

## Journey 3 (Draft)
Deployment

### Journey 3.1 (Draft)
CI/CD

## Journey 4 (Draft)
Transform monolithic app into microservices (modify app, modify CI/CD)

## Journey 5 (Draft)
Scaling with Kubernetes

### Journey 5.1 (Draft)
Improve deployment with ArgoCD

## Journey 6 (Draft)
Observability(logging, monitoring, tracing)

## Journey 7 (Draft)
Toward IaC

## Journey 8 and more (Draft)
ideas
- extend app features
- event driven architecture
